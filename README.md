# Self-assessment

## My role: looking for information and facts

I think that the role that I played in this team was the team member that questioning everything. I felt a kind of disadvantage because I didnâ€™t have enough time to practice and get more knowledge as my teammates, nevertheless this disadvantage helps my team not to assume things so easily. I think that all team members were an useful complement to each other.

## My team: Commitment towards the goals
I would say that this team provide me an incredible learning experience. The area of expertise that each team member was the most valuable characteristic because help us to solve the issues during the project development. Every class we were able to share our doubts, we have an open communication, no one was left with doubts; but the most important we were able to split tasks and completed on time, no delays, each member trusts and supports each other. 

## Our project

After six months of hard work, now the time to look for a job is coming and with that the risk to be part of a fraud increases.  The technology has allowed to access easily to more and more job opportunities but also it has opened the door to scams that compromise our online security and expose us to possible identity theft. Negative outcomes also include emotional and mental suffering that result from engaging in the scam.

That why we choose this project, we want to help people to identify key data in a job posting to avoid falling victim to fraudulent jobs. The source of Data for this analysis came from the popular site Kaggle, published on february 2020 by Shivan Bansal- Senior Data Scientist.  

The key questions we were looking to answer after all this work were:
-What are the primary indicators for fake job postings?
-Are fake job postings more common in certain parts of the US?

In order to answer these questions, we used Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 85%, a precision of 95% and a recall of 85%.
